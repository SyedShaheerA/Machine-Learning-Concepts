# Machine Learning Concepts Repository

## 📌 Overview
This repository is dedicated to explaining and demonstrating core **Machine Learning (ML) concepts** through **theory, mathematics, and practical code examples**.  
It serves as a learning resource for beginners and an organized reference for intermediate learners who want to understand **how machine learning models work under the hood**.

The focus is on building intuition first, then reinforcing it with **hands-on implementations using Python and scikit-learn**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Explain fundamental machine learning concepts in a **simple and intuitive way**
- Connect **mathematical foundations** with real code implementations
- Demonstrate common ML algorithms with **clear examples and visualizations**
- Highlight **best practices**, assumptions, and common pitfalls

---
